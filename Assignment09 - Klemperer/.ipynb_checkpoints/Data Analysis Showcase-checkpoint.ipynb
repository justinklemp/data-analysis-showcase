    "For this assignment, I was happy to be able to have the freedom to analyze whatever datasets we wanted. I couldn't make up my mind with just one set of data, so I decided to use three different ones that I wanted to work with and interested me. I've recently become a pretty big fan of the UFC because I find it incredibly interesting to see how different martial art styles and types of fighters compare against eachother within the highest caliber. I'm very excited to try and identify some trends to understand what type of fighters and match ups generate the highest pay-per view sales and the most successful fight cards. I also decided to use the TED X data because I am curious to see what the most popular TED talks are, and who the individuals are and what topic they chose to speak upon. I think that Ted Talks bring great value for listeners to develop new perspectives. Lastly, I've always wanted to use some sort of NHL data. I think it would be interesting to create some cool new connections because this dataset I found shows you a record for every goal, assist, player, team, name, even their death year and nickname! I'm excited to see what I can find from all three of these datasets.\n",

This was a stunning victory, and the rematch was even crazier. Still to this day, the Mcgregor vs Diaz 2 UFC card is still debated as the best fight in UFC history. Connor Mcgregor barely won by decision after an incredible 5-round fight by both opponents."

    "The Brock Lesnar vs Frank Mir fight was one of the largest events in UFC history, and back in 2009 this was one of the kickstarters that made the UFC a common household name after these two giant heavyweight fighters tee'd off on one another until Frank Mir lost via TKO in the second round from Brock Lesnar. For the time in 2009, this was an unpresidented success for pay-per view during this time relative to other UFC main title fight cards."
